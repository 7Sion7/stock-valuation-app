# Description: 
In this web application built with Flask and Jinja, you are able to get the cap price of any stock share by either searching the using the ticker symbol or name of the desired stock, 
or manually through the cap price calculator where you can add in the annual returns in dividends of each year for the stock you desire to valuate. The information this app will provide
is: Percentage of Average Annual Returns in Dividends, Annual Return in Dividends in U$D, Stock's Current Price, Historical Information of Returns in Dividends of the Past 6 Years,
and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the Cap Price of that stock, meaning the price you'd have to pay to get at least a 6% return in dividends. 
# This app is great for shortlisting the stocks you are looking at, just so you are able to filter out those stocks that are too expensive at the time based on their annual returns. 
# That's very useful as then you won't be wasting any time thoroughly studying stocks that are too expensive, and you can focus on the ones that can give you greater returns and less risk.
